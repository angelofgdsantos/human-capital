This repository contains my codes and routines for the human capital course. In this course we replicate models used in the papers mentioned below:
 * **DHS: Incentives Work: Getting Teachers to Come to School by Esther Duflo, Rema Hanna and Stephen P. Ryan** 
      
	In this paper, the authors used a RCT that took place in India in order to study the role of financial incentive in teacher absenteeism. The authors added a structural model to the reduced form approach present in a previous paper.
